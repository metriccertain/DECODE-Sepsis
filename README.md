SQL programs are copied from the [MIMIC concepts code repository] (https://github.com/MIT-LCP/mimic-code/tree/main/mimic-iv/concepts)

Rmd programs are used to derive the MIMIC-IV data and to write csv files that are nearly ready for input into the models

Python programs load the models and score the MIMIC-IV data
